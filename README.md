### What is Web Scraping ?

Web Scraping (also termed Screen Scraping, Web Data Extraction, Web Harvesting etc.) is a technique employed to extract large amounts of data from websites whereby the data is extracted and saved to a local file in your computer or to a database in table (spreadsheet) format.

Data displayed by most websites can only be viewed using a web browser. They do not offer the functionality to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option then is to manually copy and paste the data - a very tedious job which can take many hours or sometimes days to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process, so that instead of manually copying the data from websites, the Web Scraping software will perform the same task within a fraction of the time.

### Web Scraping Softwere :

A web scraping software will automatically load and extract data from multiple pages of websites based on your requirement. It is either custom built for a specific website or is one which can be configured to work with any website. With the click of a button you can easily save the data available in the website to a file in your computer.

### Methods of Web Scraping :

**Using software :** 

Web Scraping software falls under 2 categories. First, which can be locally installed in your computer and second, which runs in cloud - browser based. WebHarvy, OutWit Hub, Visual Web Ripper etc. are examples of web scraping software which can be installed in your computer, whereas import.io, Mozenda etc. are examples of cloud data extraction platforms.

**Writing code :**

You can hire a developer to build custom data extraction software for your specific requirement. The developer can in-turn make use of web scraping APIs which helps him/her develop the software easily. For example apify.com lets you easily get APIs to scrape data from any website.

### What is the best programming language for Web Scraping ?

#### Python libraries for Web Scraping :

**Scrapy** and **Beautiful Soup** are among the widely used frameworks based on Python that makes scraping using this language such an easy route to take.

**Beautiful Soup :** 

Beautiful soup is a Python library that’s designed for fast and highly efficient web scraping. Some of the notable features are Pythonic idioms for navigation, searching, and modifying a parse tree. Beautiful Soup can also convert incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. Beautiful Soup works on popular Python parsers like lxml and html5lib, which allow you to try different parsing methodologies.
